# Visual Style Bible (Midjourney + Runway)

This is the shared art direction for chapter stills and short videos. Keep it consistent across the whole web novel.

## Global Rules

- No text, lettering, subtitles, UI overlays, logos, watermarks.
- Aspect ratio: **16:9**.
- Prefer 1 clear subject per frame. Strong negative space.
- Reuse motifs: glass curvature, refraction, waveforms, grids, hairline flaws, gaps/offsets (translation loss).

## Two-World Look

### Continental (Kael/Moss)

- Palette: sun-baked amber, oxidized green, soot black, salt white.
- Texture: grit, hand-made tools, weathered stone/concrete, rusted metal, dust motes.
- Light: warm lamplight, hard sun, smoke/haze, high contrast.
- Camera: handheld feel, 35mm/50mm, shallow depth for intimacy.

### Antarctic (Sūrya/VEDA)

- Palette: ice blue, bone white, graphite, sterile gray with one restrained accent (teal/cyan).
- Texture: matte composites, clean seams, soft fog, diffuse reflections.
- Light: even, indirect, high-CRI, almost shadowless.
- Camera: stable, centered compositions; wide symmetrical corridors; slow deliberate motion.

### Dual / Contact Scenes

- Palette + texture collisions: warm elements intruding into clean geometry, or sterile light on messy bodies.
- Composition should *show* translation distortion: offset reflections, split focus, double images.

## Character Continuity (Stills)

- Kael: dark brown skin, close-cropped hair, burn scar left forearm, strong hands.
- Moss: sailor build, crooked nose, tar/salt world; post-mod eyes lighten gradually.
- Sūrya: very pale skin, large gray eyes, long dark hair, precise posture.
- VEDA: no face. Show as light patterns, node grids, or “presence” (not a robot body).

## Midjourney Defaults

- Use a consistent parameter set unless a chapter demands otherwise:
  - `--ar 16:9 --style raw --stylize 100`
- Negative: `--no text --no letters --no watermark --no logo --no subtitles`

## Runway Defaults

- Duration: 4-8s.
- Motion: subtle (slow push-in, gentle pan, drifting particles, soft water movement).
- Prefer loopable shots (no hard cuts unless intentionally jarring).
- Use the Midjourney cover still as a reference frame when possible.
