# Hindi Style Guide (Internal)

Goal: Hindi that reads like a novel, not like a manual. Preserve the Continental vs Antarctic voice split.

## Voice Mapping

- Continental POV (Kael/Moss): more colloquial Hindi, tighter sentences, sensory-first. Avoid over-Sanskritization.
- Antarctic POV (Sūrya): more formal/precise Hindi, cleaner syntax, technical vocabulary when needed.
- VEDA voice: short, regular paragraphs; clinical tone; no melodrama.

## Formatting

- Preserve the chapter header and metadata comment.
- Preserve scene breaks (`---` / `***`) and blockquotes (`> `).
- Keep Satya terms italicized (`*dharma*`, `*dā*`) and do not explain them in-line.

## Proper Names

- Keep canonical spellings: Kael, Moss, Sūrya, VEDA.
- If you add Devanagari spellings, do it only on first mention and keep it consistent:
  - Sūrya (सूर्या), Kael (केल/काएल), Moss (मॉस) as you choose once.

## Diction Rules (Avoid Robotic Hindi)

- Prefer active verbs over “किया/करना” chains when possible.
- Avoid filler intensifiers: “बहुत”, “वास्तव में”, “दरअसल” repeated.
- Use idiomatic Hindi, but do not introduce modern slang that breaks 2587 tone.
- Keep swearing/roughness plausible; don’t sanitize Continental chapters.

## Translation Fidelity

- Keep meaning faithful, but allow re-phrasing to preserve emotion and momentum.
- If an English metaphor does not survive, replace it with an equivalent *image* that fits the POV’s metaphor pool (glass/sea vs geometry/light).
